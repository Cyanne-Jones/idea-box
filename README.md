### How Does It Work?

Using our app allows you to keep all of your *amazing* in one place! Just enter your idea's title, & your idea itself in the "body" input and click save! Your idea is now saved into the box below for future use!

What if I don't like my idea anymore? Press the white "x" button on the idea card and *boom* it's gone! You're also more than welcome to click on the star button to favorite your idea, and the star will turn orange to show you, our valued user, that your idea is AMAZING.

To access this app, clone down this repository into your machine, and open up the index.html file in your browser. You're now able to save all of your great ideas in one convenient place!

#### What We Removed
-We originally had all of the styling to match the comp including the search bar, filter starred ideas button, comment +, etc.

-Updated for user experience so our final project didn't have unused buttons or features.

-And yes, it was painful to remove all of that work. Check out previous branches to see all of that beautiful code. :)

#### Future Ideas
-Adding a "filter by favorite" function

-Animations on save to show how good your idea is!
